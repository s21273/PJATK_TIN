    <h1><b>Music good for the soul</b></h1>
  </header>

	<p><mark> We’ve all heard the idiom, “Music is good for the soul.” But according to the evidence, it’s good for your health as well.</mark></p>

  <p ><i>Study after study has found that music therapy has a positive effect on a broad range of physical and psychological conditions including dementia, anxiety, depression, and cancer.</i></p>

  <p><em>  Music therapy is a service that can be delivered by psychologists, therpaists, or caregivers in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and even outpatient clinics. The goal is to improve people’s health through music experiences such as free improvisation, singing, and listening to, discussing, and moving to music.!</em></p>
  
  <p><small>There is plenty of evidence to show that music therapy used in health care settings can help calm patients. And given that there are no negative side effects, it’s certainly a treatment worth trying.</small></p>
